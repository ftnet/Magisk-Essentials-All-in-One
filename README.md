## Magisk-Essentials-All-in-One v2017.05.24-ARM by @VR25



## INFO
This mod will instal Magisk v12, followed by other goodies.

This is meant to be installed through `recovery ONLY.`

Prior to installing, you must boot your freshly installed OS first.

Once booted, don't touch anything (don't set things up yet), reboot and install this pack.

If you choose not to boot first, then the included user apps won't be installed (proceed so if you don't want them)
As always, do it at your own risk.
